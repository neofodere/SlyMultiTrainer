    - Added "Strings" tab for Sly 2 & 2:
        - A tab that contains 2 sub-tabs:
            - "Localized" tab:
                - Populated on map change.
                - These strings are localized on non-english versions of the games.
                - Each entry represents the string id and the string itself, separated by a "-" symbol.
                - NOTE: The app internally sorts the list by string id.
            - "Savefile" tab:
                - Each entry represents a field in the savefile region.
                - NOTE: The app internally sorts the list by address.
    - Entities:
        - Added button "Warp entity to active character".
        - The search bar now also searches through the entities' addresses.
    - DAG:
        - The "Set state to" function has been changed so that it also writes to the savefile, meaning the change persists between loads.
        - Added job/checkpoint loading for Version 0 (Sly 2 NTSC March 17 and Sly 2 NTSC E3 Demo).
        - Added "Load to this entrance location" for Version 0.
        - Fixed a bug in which loading specific checkpoints (e.g. Sly 3 episode 1 "t1_gauntlet_interior_intro") would forcefully load the map in 3D.
        - Fixed a bug in which loading a checkpoint would set to 1 the "Focus count" and the "Complete count" of tasks with the state set to "Available".
            - E.g. Loading the Sly 2 episode 7 "t7_robot_war_intro_ext" task, abandoning the job and then entering the trigger for the "t7_bearcave_intro_ext" task would not play its binocucom dialogue.
    - Sly 1:
        - Implemented fly accelerate forward.
        - NTSC (PS3 PSN):
            - Fixed a bug that always loaded a map with the english language.

        - Warping now takes into account if the character's origin is not 0,0,0.
        - Changed default text encoding from UTF8 to Windows-1252 (fixes the DAG tab when playing in Finnish).
        - NTSC March 17:
            - Fixed a crash when the user double left clicked on a task or a cluster (to load a checkpoint/job) in the DAG tab.
        - NTSC PlayStation Magazine Demo Disc 089:
            - Removed inaccessible maps from the maps combobox.
    - Sly 3:
        - Added gadget binds editor.
